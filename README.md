<h1>Organizer</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Organizer is a tool that tracks down students' assignments from NYU Classes and organize them into a website so students do not neccessarily have to log in to NYU Classes and check for assignments for each of the class. Another goal is is to provide an efficient time estimation of similar taks in the future based on assignments' histories.</p>
  
  
 <h2>History</h2>
 <p>We are a group of NYU students who are annoyed by how time consuming that tracking down of all assignments from NYU Classes would be. We would like to develop a tool in which help students focus and spend more time in studying rather than constantly worrying about new assignments being published on NYU Classes (school website)</p>
